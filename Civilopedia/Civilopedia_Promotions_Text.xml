			<Text>Unfortunately, early carriers tended to be slow … too slow to keep up with the battleships and cruisers of the main fleet and fulfill their role of providing air support. Also, if left behind by the main fleet, aircraft carriers were terribly vulnerable; just about anything could sink these lumbering, thin-skinned vessels. Thus, the fleet carriers – made possible by interwar advances in engine design. Although the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the displacement of carriers to 23,000 tons of water, everyone ignored that. The concept of a fleet carrier was developed in 1931 by American admirals Clark and Yarnell … fast enough to keep up with the fleet and be protected by it. The Essex class of American fleet carriers – driven by Westinghouse geared turbines hooked to eight boilers – became the 20th Century’s most numerous class of capital ship.</Text>

			<Text>As artillery became more powerful, and able to hit targets further and further away, better and faster ways of calculating the trajectory and point of impact became necessary. The time of open sights and sticking a finger in the air were over. Thus, stadiametric rangefinders … an advance over the Roman dodecahedron rangefinder as described by Julius Caesar in 'De Bello Gallico.' In effect, the stadiametric approach used a modified telescope to calculate distances quickly, based on the principle that in similar triangles, similar sides are proportional, which comes in handy when trying to hit a distant spot – be that a wall, or a moving ship. In fact, by the mid-1800s stadiametric rangefinders were found in every coastal fortification.</Text>

			<Text>When artillery moved from solid shot to explosive shells, grapeshot was replaced with shrapnel shells, designed to explode above the ground in an airburst and shower those below with lethal little balls; it was invented by Henry Shrapnel around 1780 AD for the British Army. By the Napoleonic Wars it was quite popular among British commanders, although difficult to manufacture and use (the shells had an unfortunate tendency to bury themselves in the ground rather than explode in the air). But by World War I, the kinks had been worked out and both sides used them to great effect.</Text>

Recognizing the choke points is a skill possessed by great and capable officers. By narrowing the enemy’s approach, an army can dictate the course of battle; military history abounds with examples: Leonidas’s defense of the pass at Thermopylae, Godwinson at the battle of Stamford Bridge, Wallace at Stirling Bridge, and, of course, Agincourt where the French were forced to attack through a narrow gap in the woods.</Text>

And Alexander the Great’s crossing of the monsoon-swollen Hydaspes to crush King Porus is considered one of the greatest victories ever. Of course, none of them faced coastal artillery, airplanes, and machine guns. But units specifically trained to land from boats and immediately engage the enemy are a relatively modern development. Until Gallipoli, the largest amphibious operation had been the Persian landing at Marathon just prior to the battle. But World War II is marked by far larger conflicts, in Africa and Europe, and across the Pacific.</Text>

			<Text>While one may have some limited combat (usually defensive) capability, in general auxiliary ships are those that keep the real combat ships functioning at peak efficiency. Without the auxiliaries, no blue-water navy can be efficient, successful, or often afloat. As European navies began to range the oceans during the 1700s and 1800s, those big men-of-war needed support vessels to replenish supplies, make repairs away from ports, and guard those naval bases scattered about the globe. When the age of steam dawned, colliers and later oilers kept the boilers in the destroyers and battleships firing. As navies became ever more diverse, so too did the auxiliary ships; the modern U.S. Navy lists some 86 different types (not counting floating repair docks).</Text>

Whereas most well-trained archers could fire about six arrows a minute, thus creating a pretty dense storm, the English archers armed with longbows were especially proficient at laying down such a rain of death … better even than crossbowmen.</Text>

			<Text>Since – unlike naval ships – sinking an opponent ship brought no profit, pirates and privateers relied on heavily armed and vicious oaring parties to storm the upper decks and so secure the (hopefully) precious cargo. In olden days before the wonder of gunpowder, boarding actions were the primary form of naval combat (far fewer were sunk by ramming) and battles were won on the decks. Boarding parties were armed with a variety of weapons, ever more lethal as time passed: cutlasses and swords, blunderbusses and flintlock pistols, belaying pins and just about anything sharp or blunt. But with the development in the early 16th Century of cannon gunports and deckguns, the use of boarding tactics gradually came to an end.</Text>

			<Text>Shore bombardment came when Edward III of England mounted bombards on some of his ships besieging Calais in 1347 AD. It has become a popular way of assaulting towns and troops ever since. Turning the fleet’s big guns on civilian targets – factories, docks, warehouses, homes, etc. – was generally frowned upon … until World War I. On 16 December 1914, the Imperial German Navy shelled the British towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby, causing 137 fatalities and widespread public outrage (some of that directed at the Royal Navy for allowing the raid to happen). The British themselves bombarded targets in the Dardanelles, Salonika and Belgian coasts. In the next war, blasting civilians was pretty much left to the air forces, the naval guns being reserved for invasions.</Text>

			<Text>A rolling barrage is a method to deliver massed firepower across a broad area, as effective by naval ships as for land-based batteries. The fact that the guns are firing from rolling, moving, unsteady platforms just makes it more challenging for the naval gunners. In effect, the guns are aimed at sequential points, typically 20 to 30 yards apart for modern shells, along a path from a few hundred to several thousand yards in length. With multiple ships firing, this can form a box, a rectangle where everything in the path is flattened. Rolling barrages during World War II proved very effective at blasting the enemy out of built-up areas and fortifications. So it was added to the naval repertoire of destruction.</Text>

			<Text>When a commander commits his heavy cavalry – be they horses or tanks – the hope is to break through the enemy’s defensive line, and then rapidly exploit the gap. Much of the battlefield maneuvering is done to mount a breakthrough attempt – focusing a large force on a small portion of the line – or to insure that reserves are available to plug the gap. For both these, the heavy, mobile units proved best. Once the enemy line is broken, the armor can penetrate deep into the rear or attack the exposed flanks of the units on either side of the breach. In either case, the battle’s probably over.</Text>

But the advent of the long-range musket and the Baker rifle made concealing oneself a survival necessity. During the French &amp; Indian War the rifle-armed Rogers’ Rangers wore gray and green uniforms, which blended in with the woodlands. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Portuguese Caçadores favored brown-jackets which helped conceal them. By the time of the First World War, all the major nations – save the French – had given up their red, white, and bright blue uniforms which made such lovely targets.</Text>

			<Text>There is nothing – at least before tanks spoiled everything – more thrilling and effective than a charge by heavy cavalry; unfortunately, they didn’t occur very often. Battles were rarely fought on level, dry, and open ground suitable for such picturesque battle. By the end of the 14th Century, in fact, most knights dismounted to fight, and their prized destriers were led to the rear … except for the French, but look what happened at Crécy, Poitiers, and Agincourt. But if the cavalry charge did reach the enemy, the shock of contact could overwhelm defensive positions, even those sheltered by field works. But the advent of machine guns, barbed wire, and mines put an end to all that glorious charging.</Text>

			<Text>Before the advent of detailed nautical charts (but after sailors trusted only luck to reach shore safely) a rutter was a mariner’s handbook of sailing directions for navigation – termed a periplus (“sailing around” book) by ancient Mediterranean sailors. These were jealously guarded by navigators and pilots throughout the Middle Ages, for they were the personal record of all one knew about the trade routes they had explored or sailed. During the Renaissance, rutters shared among city merchant-traders made the likes of Pisa, Genoa, and Venice incredibly wealthy. The Age of Discovery brought rutters to even more prominence, as they were the nautical record of how to reach those distant places again. Eventually, all this private knowledge got replaced by nautical charts, and sailing became far less adventurous.</Text>

			<Text>In military terms, close air support (CAS) is aerial attacks on enemy ground forces that are in close proximity to friendly forces, demanding coordination with these friendly forces so as not to accidentally bomb and strafe them. There had been some CAS operations during World War I, and the British debuted the first ground attack airplane – modified F.E.2b fighters – in late 1917. After the war, the victorious powers weren’t particularly interested in further research and designs for CAS … but the defeated Germans were. Forbidden strategic bombers by the Treaty of Versailles, the Luftwaffe turned to CAS dive bombers, with the famous Junkers Ju-87 (the Stuka) the first result. Incredibly successful in the Spanish Civil War for the Condor Legion, it proved able to hit enemy positions with near pinpoint accuracy.</Text>

			<Text>Not long after pilot Louis Quénault and observer Joseph Frantz shot down an enemy plane with a machine gun in aerial combat in October 1914, aircraft engineers started considering how to add armor to protect the most vulnerable part of a fighter plane … the pilot. Unfortunately, weight was a concern for those wooden and canvas planes; any extra affected a fighter’s performance. Nevertheless, the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte and Royal Air Force saw some value in keeping their pilots alive, so a few planes were retrofitted with lightly armored pilot’s seats. By World War II, most fighters had cockpit armor, and shatter-proof canopies, to help deflect all that fire from above and especially below.</Text>

			<Text>In the 1880s, the British Admiralty – recognizing the improvement of naval guns and ammunition – issued a requirement for a new rangefinder accurate to 3% at 3000 yards. In 1888, professors Archibald Barr and William Stroud built the first coincidence rangefinder that did just that; by 1898 their firm had sold over 150 around the world, most fitted to battleships. The device consisted of a long tube with a forward-facing lens at each end, two prism wedges inside, and an eyepiece in the center; The operator can rotate the prisms until the two images align; the degree of rotation of each will then give the range to a distant target by simple triangulation. Coincidence rangefinders became the naval standard … until replaced by modern laser rangefinders.</Text>

Although several nations had units trained in unconventional attacks on “high-value targets,” the term “commando” was first used in relation to the Boer bands of militia which raised havoc with the British at the beginning of the 1900s.  So impressed were the British, that in 1941 their Imperial General Staff adopted the name for their volunteer units raised to raid the German-occupied continent.

			<Text>Naval convoys have been around since at least since the 12th Century, when classes of warships became distinct and different sorts had different, coordinated roles to play in an engagement. During the age of colonization, Spain and Portugal sent military escorts with their lumbering treasure ships to ward off pirates and privateers. Convoy tactics figured prominently during the Napoleonic War, as Britain sought to interdict French grain fleets; several battles – Ushant, Dogger Bank and the Glorious First of June – swirled around convoys. During World War I, a convoy system was instituted by the British Admiralty to counter the threat of German submarines, a policy carried over to the far deadlier Battle of the Atlantic in the next great war.</Text>

			<Text>During the early stage of the anti-submarine war, during the final run of a convoy escort to drop stern-mounted depth charges on a skulking U-boat contact was lost by the active sound detection system (ASDIC) … giving the German sub the chance to change depth or direction at the last minute. To counter this, the Royal Navy’s 36 Escort Group devised the “Creeping Attack.” Using two ships, one stationary to maintain contact and one to close on the target, the latter releasing its depth charges on a signal from the first. Although the tactic required patience, and took extra time and ships, it proved effective. The arrival of more sophisticated ASDIC, along with forward-throwing Hedgehog and Squid depth charges, made the tactic obsolete – although the British continued to use it to war’s end.</Text>

Based on the hoary old traditions of Platonic philosophy, these debates were judged based on the debaters’ citation of “accepted” written works and the usual rhetorical skills of spokesmen. Disputations between Catholic and Jewish theologians (such as that in Paris in 1240) were quite polite; those between Protestants and Catholics (for instance, Regensburg in 1541) somewhat less so. Meanwhile, to the East the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great was hosting disputations between Muslim, Hindu, Jain, Zoroastrian, and Catholic Jesuit holy men as a show of his religious tolerance.</Text>

			<Text>In 1922, with the launch of the USS Langley, it became obvious that dedicated aircraft carriers would need dedicated flight deck (and later, hangar deck) crews for efficient launch and recovery operations, and maintenance of all the temperamental aeroplanes. By the time World War II got started, well-trained deck crews could land, service, and launch a squadron of planes as though their lives depended on it … as they did. The crews became highly organized, with a hierarchy of tasks under the supervision of the likes of the air officer, catapult officer, aircraft directors, signal officers, and dozens of others. Refueling, rearming, and repairs were handled on the flight deck in combat, sometimes even as the carrier was trying to avoid being sunk.</Text>

			<Text>Light cavalry in the 1700s and 1800s – especially the flamboyant types like hussars and lancers – were generally used for scouting, skirmishing, and raiding. In general, their use on the battlefield was limited until after the fighting, when they were unleashed to run down the fleeing enemy. But upon occasion the light cavalry was used to charge enemy artillery, usually suffering daunting casualties before nearing the guns. Whereupon the gunners would run to the nearest friendly infantry, and the horsemen would dismount to spike the guns, driving a barbed steel spike into the touch-hole and rendering the guns useless. A popular tactic for many decades; indeed, Count Friedrich von Bismarck recommended that every cavalryman should carry spikes. </Text>

Then, a few pilots started taking shots at enemy pilots with pistols. Before anyone knew it, planes were equipped with machine guns (after Fokker solved that problem of shooting through a spinning propeller), and dogfighting began. Adventurous pilots invented maneuvers – such as the Immelmann and Low Yo-Yo – to give themselves an advantage in battle.

The earliest recorded use is when the Thebans attacked the Spartans at the battle of Leuctra with their left wing while they use an echelon formation to refuse their weak right flank; they won … one of the few defeats the Spartans ever suffered. The use of echelon did not pass away with the arrival of gunpowder; the famed Jomini wrote extensively about it in his works on linear tactics, influential on European and American officers for decades after.</Text>

In open sea, the Greek triremes usually sailed in single line, led by the commander’s ship. However, upon sight of the enemy warships, the Greek fleet would deploy into a triangular or trapezoid formation, with the courageous commander’s ship at the tip. This formation meant the enemy had a limited front to fire missiles at, and gave the superior Greek seamen the chance to use their rams to best effect while shielding the sides of the ship ahead – any enemy turning to ram would be instead rammed by the next ship in the wedge. So effective was the embolon that it remained in use, until cannon made it a liability.</Text>

This was especially useful for keeping the crews manning the siege artillery – be these catapult or cannon – alive, for they tended to draw attention as they sought to batter down the walls. The introduction of gunpowder made this even more essential, as cannon mounted on walls could lob shells quite a distance. Temporary redoubts and emplacements meant the guns could keep firing on the walls until these were breached; in 1453 AD, for example, Mehmed II’s 62 cannon – protected by earthen ramparts – hammered away at the walls of Constantinople for six weeks.</Text>

Upon occasion, they were also assigned to provide security to civilians, notably to settlers and work parties; indeed, during the settling of the American west, South Africa, and Australia, light cavalry accompanied wagon trains, railroad work crews, freight caravans, and even stagecoaches (if somebody or something important was aboard) across territories full of hostile natives. The military escort, generally unhappy with such babysitting duty, tended to hurry these folk along at a brisk pace. Thus, making everyone happier when their destination was reached.</Text>

So, usually straight and steady was the best defense, and it gave the plane’s gunners at least some chance of hitting their targets. But, upon (desperate) occasion they would engage in aerial hijinks. Lone bombers would try air-braking or the corkscrew (a series of steep diving and climbing turns) when attacked. Against ground fire, these might work, but most bomber pilots preferred to jink to throw off the aim of the AA gunners below.

Introduced by the Swedes during the Thirty Years War, horse artillery became a staple for all the “modern” armies, and the guns themselves became larger and yet lighter. Thus, battlefield cannon evolved … unfortunately, that meant that the crews needed to be better trained. But it wasn’t until 1915, when Britain established the School of Instruction for Royal Horse and Field Artillery (the world’s first) at Larkhill that such training was available, making its graduates “experts” in fire-and-move artillery tactics.</Text>

But as artillery passed into the gunpowder era, with longer ranges and often smaller targets, that wasn’t as effective. Thus, a number of devices were invented to help with the ballistic calculations for cannon. The first recorded device to measure elevation angles was the gunner’s quadrant, c. 1545 AD. In 1742 the ballistic pendulum invented by Benjamin Robins revolutionized artillery fire. And in 1892, the firm of Barr &amp; Stroud were awarded a contract by the British Army for six rangefinders, the very first ones.

Flaming projectiles fired from bows, catapults, and cannons have been used ever since the first recorded instances of the Assyrians and the Judeans did so. When gunpowder made its appearance, so did the carcass, a hollow iron projectile filled with a highly flammable mixture to lob over the walls, first used by the French in 1672 AD.</Text>

The first plane to launch from a warship (USS Birmingham) occurred in November 1910; two months later, the first plane to land on a warship platform (USS Pennsylvania) was piloted by Eugene Fly. The first aircraft carrier that actually had a “modern” flight deck was the converted liner HMS Argus, whose upper works had been cut away and a large wooden platform laid over the hull. It was used to experiment with possibilities, including the construction of a starboard “island” to serve as bridge and chartrooms and briefing room and control tower.

By the time of World War II, Japanese and American fleet carriers often carried two or more fighter squadrons, a couple of torpedo-bomber squadrons, at least one dive bomber squadron, and several scout planes. There was not nearly enough room up top for these 80 to 100 planes on a typical carrier. Thus, between the wars naval designers incorporated a “hangar deck” – a carrier’s garage – on the latest. Located two decks below the flight deck, the hangar deck on the USS Eisenhower for instance is 110 feet wide, 25 feet high and 685 feet long … plenty of room for 60 planes, as well as fuel tanks and heavy repair equipment.</Text>

Since adding another hangar deck was impractical, naval “thinkers” turned to more radical solutions for packing more planes onto fleet carriers … and so folding wings were incorporated into new carrier plane designs. Despite the misgivings of some pilots (who weren’t real keen on the possibility of their wings folding up while aloft), aircraft such as the British Supermarine Spitfire and Fairy Gannet were soon aboard British carriers; by the late 1930s virtually all American carrier planes had been converted to folding wings.

Because these are indirect fire weapons, so long as a battery commander knew where the target was, impediments to line of sight such as hills, trees, buildings, and such were no problem. Although there had been some use of forward observers since the Crimean War, World War I made them indispensable. Using binoculars and rangefinders, and the terrain for concealment, communicating with the battery commander via field phone or radio, a spotter could change the course of a modern battle with one well-placed and unexpected barrage.</Text>

For garrisons, fighting from behind walls and well-motivated (since there was no place to retreat to), proved the best defense against attackers. Often the garrison troops had their families with them … also a motivation to defend the place to the death. The ability of garrisons to stave off assaults is the primary reason there are so many sieges in history.</Text>

			<Text>First used during the Hussite Wars in cannon and “hand-cannon” (clumsy pistols), grapeshot proved very effective against enemy infantry. In effect, grapeshot is a mass of small metal (or even stone) bits packed tightly in the barrel; when fired, the metal bits spread out like buckshot, although with far deadlier results. It was something new in warfare, for ancient artillery simply weren’t capable of such a shotgun approach. At sea, grapeshot was used to clear the decks of enemy ships, although less effective than firing on a dense formation of soft targets in the open. In time, rather than just being shoveled in, the small bits were packed into special shells – canister shot – that broke open when fired.</Text>

European mortars were virtually too heavy to move, until Menno van Coehoorn devised lighter ones, using explosive shells to blast walls apart at the siege of Grave.

A good helmsman had a keen sense of how his ship would react to different conditions (wind, swells, currents, and storms) and was able to anticipate the delay between changing the helm and when the ship would respond to the rudder.

The mounted infantry of the Han dynasty dismounted and formed squares in their many battles against the fearsome Xiongnu. The square formation, which fell out of favor during the Middle Ages, was revived in the 14th Century, and would figure prominently during the Napoleonic Wars.

This indiscriminate bombing of an entire area is quite effective, if expensive in terms of munitions, in leveling fields and farms, industrial areas, neighborhoods, and everything else. The first instance of carpet bombing was that by the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War against enemy forces scattered on the rocky slopes during the battle of El Mazuco.

Often these were dedicated to a specific type of ship, as with the British destroyer tenders of the world wars. Almost anything with a large cargo capacity could serve as a tender … and did.

Usually ridden by men-at-arms and squires, these were battle-trained, lightly-armored, and used to operate on the flanks of the battle, riding down archers, artillerymen, and others.  (Meanwhile, of course, the heavy knights on their destriers were duking it out for God, king, and glory in the center.)

It proved a boon to naval raiders, who found it challenging to find a place to scrape and clean their hull.

The command’s B-24 Liberator bombers were spending an inordinate amount of time grounded for maintenance; Waddington’s team gathered data and concluded that too much time was being spent on preventive maintenance as opposed to repairs necessary to keep the bombers at combat readiness. These findings lead to his concept of "force readiness"; although foregoing regular maintenance might lead to problems with some planes, far fewer were out of action at any given time. In fact, effective flying hours for Coastal Command’s bombers increased by around 60%.</Text>

But, given that most fighters of the day were unarmored and their weapons could rarely penetrate the tank armor, they weren’t very effective … in fact, the RAF suffered losses approaching 30% among ground-attack aircraft in 1918. But when Europe went at it again in 1939, fighter-bombers devoted to attacking tanks were common, such as the German Stuka, British Hurricane Mk IID, and Russian Sturmovik.

The unwieldly Greek spear eventually gave way to various pole weapons, which combined the thrust of the spear with the cutting edge of the axe: the halberd, glaive, bill, and pike … the latter the dominate weapon in the 1500s and 1600s. </Text>

But, the mass bomber raids of World War II were another matter; formations helped defend against enemy fighters, deliver the most bombs on target, and kept the bombers from running into each other. With losses among the first USAAF daylight missions over occupied Europe reaching staggering numbers, Colonel Curtis LeMay developed the combat box formation in August 1942. By December 1942, while losses were still high, these had dropped substantially. In short order, the “Javelin Down” combat box formation was adopted by both the Americans and British for all bombing operations.</Text>

Barding from chest protectors to the full harness of plate armor developed first in the armories of Lombardy. Complete barding consisted of five main pieces: chanfron (face), crinière (neck), croupier (hind quarters), flanchard (flanks) and peytral (chest).

During the inter-war years, all three devoted significant efforts to developing more reliable torpedoes and designing special aircraft to deliver these.

So long as the tortoise held, they were covered from shin to skull.

Fighting in built-up areas is a tactical nightmare, but by the Middle Ages some military units came to specialize in it.

After the first release, usually fire was either done by ranks – as at Agincourt where English longbowmen slaughtered the French knights – or “at will.” Given that most of the militia armies until the 1600s were untrained peasants, the tactic worked fairly well against equally untrained charging militia.

While light, rapid-fire AA guns such as the Bofors and Oerlikon autocannons could, and did, throw up a lot of metal in the path of the oncoming plane, it was fire of the heavier AA (such as the 38-caliber) that had the punch to knock one out of the sky if they could hit it.

These would follow a pre-set pattern until they ran out of fuel or hit something, perfect against formations of ships.

As the war progressed, rather than simply wandering about until a target was found for their torpedoes, U-boats patrolled separately but strung out along coordinated lines across convoy lanes. When a U-boat captain spotted a convoy, he signaled the others of the “pack” to gather and launch a series of attacks on the merchants while bypassing their overstretched escorts.
