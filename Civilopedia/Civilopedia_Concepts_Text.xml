			<Text>Where to Construct Cities</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_CITIES_3_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1">
			<Text>Cities should be constructed in locations with plenty of [ICON_Food] Food and [ICON_Production] Production and with access to Strategic, Luxury, and Bonus resources. It is often a good idea to build a city on a River or coastal hex, as sources of water are very important to a growing [ICON_Citizen] Population. Cities constructed on Hills gain a defensive bonus, making it harder for enemies to capture them.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_CITIES_3_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>With a Settler selected, ideal city locations will be shown on the map with an icon. Additionally, every Settler after your first will show the Settler Lens, giving you an idea of where on the map will provide the best source of water for your city, and indicating unavailable tiles.</Text>

			<Text>Your city will grow, or add more [ICON_Citizen] Citizens, with surplus [ICON_Food] Food. Any amount of [ICON_Food] Food over the total consumption of a city's [ICON_Citizen] Citizens, 2 per, is considered surplus, and is added as progress towards a new [ICON_Citizen] Citizen.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_CITIES_12_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2">
			<Text>A city will add all surplus [ICON_Food] Food towards growth if its current [ICON_Citizen] Population is 2 or more below the city's [ICON_Housing] Housing limit. If the city is 1 [ICON_Citizen] Population below its [ICON_Housing] Housing limit, its growth will slow to 50%. When the [ICON_Citizen] Population is at the [ICON_Housing] Housing limit, it will grow only at 25% the normal rate. A city can grow to 5 [ICON_Citizen] Citizens over its [ICON_Housing] Housing limit at this rate, and then it will stop growing entirely.</Text>

			<Text>A city will stagnate and not grow if it does not have surplus [ICON_Food] Food. If it makes less [ICON_Food] Food than its [ICON_Citizen] Citizens consume, the city will starve and slowly lose [ICON_Citizen] Population until it is able to support itself again.</Text>

			<Text>A city requires 2 [ICON_Food] Food per [ICON_Citizen] Citizen (another term for "[ICON_Citizen] Population") per turn to avoid starvation. A city acquires [ICON_Food] Food (as well as other yields) by assigning its [ICON_Citizen] Citizens to "work" the land around the city. The city can work any tile within 3 spaces of the city that is also within the civilization's borders, provided as well that it is not being worked by another city. Cities cannot work tiles occupied by wonders.</Text>

			<Text>Many buildings grant [ICON_Housing] Housing. After researching Pottery, every city is able to build a Granary, which adds 2 [ICON_Housing] Housing, and later they can build Sewers, which also adds 2 [ICON_Housing] Housing. Buildings in other districts sometimes add [ICON_Housing] Housing, such as the Barracks in the Encampment district, the University in the Campus, and the Lighthouse in the Harbor. The Palace building in your capital city also adds 1 [ICON_Housing] Housing.</Text>

			<Text>Each Farm, Pasture, Plantation, or Camp supports a small amount of [ICON_Citizen] Population — 1 [ICON_Housing] Housing for every 2 such improvements.

			<Text>Placing your city near a water source should be one of your first decisions in any game. The presence of a good water source will immediately set the initial [ICON_Housing] Housing level of a city. A city not adjacent to any water will have a max [ICON_Citizen] Population of 2 at the start. A city on the coast will have a max [ICON_Citizen] Population of 3.

Aqueducts may only be placed in tiles that are adjacent to a River, Lake, or Mountain that is also adjacent to the City Center.

Click on the district to order the city to begin construction, opening the district placement lens. Here, you will be given an overview of the different yield outcomes available on the tiles surrounding your City Center, and you can better make a decision about where to place your district. This lens will also show you which tiles are unavailable, as some districts have very specific placement requirements (for example, the Encampment cannot be built adjacent to a City Center). Furthermore, all districts must be built within 3 tiles of a City Center.</Text>

[ICON_Citizen] Citizens can work tiles that are within three tiles' distance from the city and that are within your civilization's borders. As your city grows, it automatically assigns its [ICON_Citizen] Citizens to work the lands around it. It seeks to provide a balanced amount of [ICON_Food] Food, [ICON_Production] Production, and [ICON_Gold] Gold. You may order a city's [ICON_Citizen] Citizens to work other tiles – for example, if you want a certain city to concentrate on generating [ICON_Gold] Gold, or [ICON_Production] Production, select the Manage Citizens icon in the City Selection Panel to choose specific tiles for your [ICON_Citizen] Citizens to work.</Text>

A Content city will not have any modifier applied to it, but a Happy city will have a 10% growth increase and a 5% yield increase. Furthermore, an Ecstatic city will have a 20% growth increase and 10% yield increase. Likewise, having too few [ICON_Amenities] Amenities will create displeasure among your [ICON_Citizen] Citizens, and the growth and yields will receive negative modifiers.

As a general rule, specialists are a good way to get yields otherwise hard to find on normal tiles, but the city needs a solid support base of [ICON_Food] Food to support them in the long term. Specialists are also particularly useful when a city grows large later in the game, and has more [ICON_Citizen] Population than there are normal tiles to work. There are different types of specialists, each with different effects. All specialist types except the generic [ICON_Citizen] Citizen have a limit on how many assignments there can be in a city. This limit is determined by the number of buildings in the district associated with that specialist type.

Each civic you acquire gives your civilization access to policies or governments, as well as some buildings, districts, and diplomatic advancements. You acquire civics by accumulating [ICON_Culture] Culture. Every turn your civilization gets some amount of [ICON_Culture] Culture added to its pool. Each civic costs a certain amount of [ICON_Culture] Culture to learn; when you've accumulated enough [ICON_Culture] Culture, you acquire the civic.

The remaining aircraft act in support of the defense by adding +5 to the strength of the main interceptor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once combat is resolved with any anti-air ground units and intercepting air units, if the attacking bomber survives, combat is then resolved with the original target. If a fighter is intercepted by another fighter on its way to a ground target, it is forced to only engage the enemy fighter and will not attack the ground target. Bombers do not have this restriction, and will continue to the target if they survives any defending interceptors and anti-air attacks.</Text>
