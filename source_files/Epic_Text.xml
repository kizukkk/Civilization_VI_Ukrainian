				Play By Cloud is an asynchronous multiplayer format where all players take their turns on a common savegame, which is stored on a hosted server. This is a more modern version of “passing the savegame,” which was the ancient practice of sharing a floppy disk with a common save file between friends (if you are unfamiliar with the concept of a “floppy disk,” please ask a respected adult of venerable age).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A Play By Cloud game may last a long time (on the order of days or weeks) as each player takes his or her turn at a time that is convenient to them. You will receive notifications when it is your turn to play. You may see an Epic notification if Epic is active, or you may use the webhooks. Webhooks are a generic message format that the technically-inclined can integrate into other messaging services, email, or Internet of Things devices.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In asynchronous multiplayer, it is considered courteous to take your turn at your earliest possible convenience to keep the game moving. In ancient times, players were morally obligated to protect the floppy disk from corruption, with unscrupulous players resorting to “losing” the savegame when in an untenable situation. Play By Cloud eliminates such rascally behavior.
