			<Text>City-states are smaller political entities that cannot win the game, but can greatly assist or impede a civilization's progress towards victory. There are a few options to deal with these city-states. You can befriend them and gain a number of important benefits, you can ignore them, or you can conquer them.</Text>

			<Text>Amstelredamme, the original name of the Dutch capital Amsterdam, was a small fishing village founded at some point in the 12th Century AD near a dam on the River Amstel. The inhabitants soon figured out they could make more coin from tolls over nearby bridges, and by digging peat out of the surrounding muck – inadvertently beginning the reclamation of the polder around the town. Amsterdam was granted city rights c. 1300 by its liege lord, the Count of Holland and Zeeland. When the Dutch revolted against Catholic Spain’s rule, economic and religious refugees (those insidious Protestants) from Spanish-controlled areas flooded into Amsterdam. Soon it was the largest city in the free Netherlands, and a thriving port as well.</Text>

			<Text>During the 17th Century, Amsterdam became the world’s wealthiest city … at least until the English beat the Netherlands in the Anglo-Dutch Wars and Napoleon overran the country during the Napoleonic Wars. But the city still dreams of its “Golden Age,” when merchants from Holland traded across the globe, sailing to North America, Africa, the Far East, and all about Europe. It was the center of great art, since artists tend to be drawn to easy money. In 1602, the Amsterdam offices of the Dutch East Indies Company became the world’s first stock exchange by trading in its own shares.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_AMSTERDAM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>The city did eventually recover its position as a great port after the troubles of the 1800s. The Industrial Revolution arrived early in Amsterdam, as the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal and the North Sea Canal dramatically improved commerce and an early train station brought goods from central Europe to its docks. Despite the effects of the Second World War (Holland managed to avoid the First), Amsterdam remains one of the world’s great commercial centers, home to some 1.5 million people (metropolitan area).</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BRUSSELS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Brussels was founded along the banks of the Senne River in 979 AD when Charles of Lorraine constructed the first fortifications around a small Catholic chapel and town. The city lay low along the river and was often flooded, giving it its Dutch name Broeksel, or, “home in the marsh.” The citizens have been trying to live that down for centuries, focusing on making it an industrial center in the “new Europe.” Extensive city walls, constructed and expanded during the 11th to 14th centuries, allowed a period of growth, expansion, and relative security uncommon for the time.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BRUSSELS_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>For some two hundred years, the city passed from one ruler to another … more or less peacefully. That ended abruptly in 1695 when Louis XIV of France sent troops to Brussels and bombarded the city with artillery, destroying the Grand Place and nearly a third of the city in the attack. This, forcefully, brought “Frenchification” to Belgium, at least in terms of culture.</Text>

			<Text>So, inevitably, in 1830 the southern French-speaking provinces of the then Kingdom of the Netherlands separated from the Dutch-speaking provinces in the “Belgian Revolution,” the conflict taking place for the most part in Brussels. Following Belgian independence, the new king Leopold I began destroying the old city walls to make way for new construction and more modern buildings for his capital. By now the Senne, once the life-blood of the city, was an open sewer and so between 1867 and 1871 was covered over.</Text>

			<Text>Brussels escaped the two world wars relatively unscathed largely due to its lack of strategic significance, the inattention of its German occupiers, and the general passivity of its inhabitants. Perhaps it is this – or the fact it is a major transportation hub – which made the city a modern-day center for international commerce and the de facto capital of the European Union and the headquarters of NATO.</Text>

			<Text>A vibrant city which rambles north to south along the Río de la Plata, Buenos Aires has been the gateway to Argentina since inception. Porteños, as the multinational citizens of Buenos Aires term themselves, possess an elaborate and rich cultural identity, drawing on Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Irish, Polish, Jewish as well as native influences; the city has often been referred to as the “Paris of South America.” Its lifestyle and architecture is more distinctly European than that of any other city in the southern hemisphere. Its physical layout is a mosaic as varied as its people, its cuisine, and its music. Buenos Aires is, not surprisingly, the most visited city in South America (ahead of even Rio de Janeiro).</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BUENOS_AIRES_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The city was founded as Ciudad de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre (“City of Our Lady Saint Mary of the Fair Winds”) in 1536 AD by a Spanish expedition. When Argentina became independent in 1816, the cosmopolitan city became its capital. In the decades between 1880 and 1940, Buenos Aires was a haven for those seeking refuge from political, religious, ideological, and artistic persecution in countries across Europe. From hungry Irish to devout Jews to Tsarist survivors, each wave of immigrants brought their traditions and talents to add to the stew, making the city the cultural rival of any world capital.</Text>

			<Text>Along with all the art and culture, Buenos Aires is a manufacturing center of the first order, with heavy industry composing 16% of the city’s economy. Factories, mostly concentrated in the southern part of the urban sprawl, produce textiles, chemicals, automobiles, beverages, and petroleum products. It also serves as the center for export of Argentina’s rich agricultural output: meat, dairy, tobacco, grain and wool. Buenos Aires isn’t just about the tango any longer.</Text>

			<Text>Until the Roman Publius Scipio Africanus plowed it under and salted the earth (so the legend goes) to conclude the Third Punic War, Carthage was one of the great cities of antiquity. Its birth beside the Gulf of Tunis is just as legendary, having been at the hands of its fabled first queen Dido. More prosaically, it actually grew from a Phoenician colony founded sometime during the first millennium BC.</Text>

			<Text>Ideally situated along the north coast of Africa, Carthage became an increasingly important center of trade in the Mediterranean through the next few centuries. However, this success was not without consequences, as Carthage eventually drew the ire of both Greece and Rome, and the ensuing conflicts with these intimidating rivals became ever more legendary.</Text>

			<Text>Tension with Greece over control of the cities of Sicily, and the intertwining trade routes, led to a series of conflicts – the Sicilian Wars. Blessed with some of the greatest generals of the time, the likes of Hamilcar Mago and his grandson Hannibal Mago, by the 3rd Century BC Carthage established complete domination over the island. During these ongoing conflicts, Rome moved to assert its power over the whole of Italy. </Text>

			<Text>Not long after the conclusion of the Pyrrhic War, continued pressure from expanding Rome drew the ire of Carthage, as the two competitors fought for control of territory and trade. A series of escalating clashes now known as the Punic Wars erupted in 264 BC, when both powers became entangled in a local squabble over control of the Sicilian city Messina. Enduring thanks primarily to the brilliant leadership of Hannibal and able others until 146 BC, beleaguered Carthage was eventually forced to surrender. The city itself was burned to the ground and much of the remaining population slaughtered, the survivors sold into slavery.</Text>

			<Text>Originally settled on a hill overlooking a nice lake by a bunch of Paleolithic nomads, by around 500 BC Geneva became a Celtic fortified town, before it was taken by the Romans in 121 BC. Ownership of the city continued to slip between the warring neighboring states, until landing in the hands of the Germans in 1033 AD. By this time Geneva had become an important ecclesiastical seat, with the bishop of the city a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor as a territorially vested prince.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_GENEVA_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Since separation of church and state wasn’t too precise, power in Geneva was contested between the Savoy dukes and the Catholic popes for the next five centuries. When the last ruling bishop fled the city in 1533, the citizens of Geneva made a risky move in an attempt to rid themselves of both the Catholics and the Savoyards – the city allied itself with the Protestant state of Bern and declared Geneva a Protestant sovereignty in 1536. It remained a stronghold of Protestant faith for years to come, although some of the population had reverted to Catholicism by the early 17th Century.</Text>

			<Text>Over time, Geneva became a center for scientific learning and research. In 1559 John Calvin founded the Geneva Academy (later University of Geneva) as a “humanist” seminary. In short order, various scientists arrived and discovered interesting things – the likes of pioneering geologist Jean-Andre Deluc, physicist Firmin Abauzit, and naturalist Francois Huber. In 1909, the university there awarded Albert Einstein the first of his honorary doctorates. More recently, Geneva has been home to Werner Arber (Nobel Prize in Medicine 1978) and Felix Bloch, the first director of CERN, which is based in a northwest suburb of the city. There’s even the Musée d’Histoire des Sciences in Geneva to commemorate all this scientific progress oozing from the city.</Text>

			<Text>Once the capital of the mighty Hittite Empire, Hattusa is now just some sunbaked ruins – although it was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites. Sometime before 2000 BC, the Hatti decided to build on the site of a prehistoric abandoned settlement on the ridge of Buyukkale, which didn’t have much to recommend it save its defensibility. In the 19th and 18th centuries BC merchants from Assyria established a trading post in the town, and introduced cuneiform writing. A century later, King Anitta destroyed the town and then cursed it for good measure, inscribing on a rock: “Whoever after me becomes king resettles Hattusas, let the Stormgod of the Sky smite him.”</Text>

			<Text>Only a generation later, his curse was ignored, as a Hittite king chose the spot for his new palace and capital. This marked the beginning of a line of Hittite “great kings,” 27 of whom are still known by name. Hattusa became the seat of learning, religion and politics for the empire; at its peak the city covered 1.8 square kilometers, surrounded by massive walls built during the reign of Suppiluliuma, c. 1333 BC. In the southern sector lay four great stone-built temples surrounded by mud-brick homes and shops. Some 40 to 50 thousand people dwelt in Hattusa at the time.</Text>

			<Text>Although it is not known for certain, Hattusa was likely the site of most of the many technological advances made by the Hittites. They were the first known to have worked with iron, forging better weapons and tools. The Hittites were the first to develop two-horse chariots, and made use of iron-rimmed wheels (rather better for those rocky roads). The farmers improved irrigation, rotated crops and invented a number of agricultural tools. But in the end, all this didn’t help much; evidence indicates the city was destroyed, together with the whole Hittite Empire, sometime around 1200 BC.</Text>

Wedged in a valley in the Hindu Kush, Kabul occupies a strategic location on the route between south and central Asia, controlling the approaches to the Khyber Pass.

Around 1400 AD, Kandy became an independent kingdom under the rule of Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu of the royal Kotte family.

The Donoughmore reforms in the 1930s, among them enforced religious tolerance, led eventually to Sri Lanka gaining independent Dominion status in 1948.

			<Text>The coast of Somalia has been of vital importance since ancient times. While we now think of the trade that passes through the Suez Canal and across to the Indian subcontinent, the region was vital even before. In Roman times, Somali and Arab merchants discouraged Indian merchants from visiting ports north of the Horn of Africa, as they were too close to Roman markets (so as to keep that lucrative connection for themselves), but they were free to establish themselves in ports such as Mogadishu, and so the city became a home for Indian traders in Africa. In addition to India and Rome, Somali merchants moved cloth and other goods from Phoenicia, Egypt, Greece, Persia, and beyond, down the Swahili coast. But networks also extended westward, into Sudan and Ethiopia. Ibn Khaldun, the Arab philosopher of the 14th century, described Mogadishu as a prosperous city, but still keeping a fundamentally nomadic character – Khaldun had proposed a cycle of history where nomadic peoples and settled peoples were in constant tension, and Mogadishu represented a triumph of the nomads. </Text>

The city must have been a comfortable place to live.</Text>

			<Text>And relatively peaceful. The city had no outer walls, although there were guard towers to the east and some defensive works to the south. Although it appears that no human threats upset the tranquility, angry gods in the form of nature certainly did. Mohenjo-daro was destroyed at least seven times, and rebuilt – the new directly on top of the old. Seems flooding of the Indus river periodically drowned all that culture. But each time it arose to again become the most sophisticated city of the world.</Text>

When the Harappan civilization went into a sudden – and as yet unexplained, although historians have lots of theories – decline around 1900 BC, Mohenjo-daro was gradually abandoned. It was lost until 1920 AD, when a visiting Indian historian, Rakhaldas Banerji, found an old flint scrapper there.</Text>

			<Text>Until it was fortified in the early 9th Century AD, Preslav was just a sleepy little Slavic settlement. But by the time of the coronation of Boris I, with his capital in nearby Pliska, it was an important strategic center and the seat of the Bulgar 'Ichirgu-boil,' commander of the capital’s garrison and de facto head of the kingdom’s military. The town also became a religious center when the Bulgars converted to Christianity in 864 and built a number of churches there.</Text>

			<Text>But Preslav’s primary business was war. Once a pagan revolt was finally defeated in 892 and Boris appointed Simeon I as his successor, the decision was made to move the capital from Pliska to the much-more Christian Preslav. For the next 80 years, not only did the new capital become the political and military center of Bulgaria, but its cultural, artistic, and religious center as well. The walls were expanded and reinforced, and its barracks became the training ground for Bulgar delusions of grandeur.</Text>

			<Text>Until, that is, the Bulgars were defeated by the Kievan prince Sviatoslav Igorevich and Preslav occupied. The ensuing war between Byzantium and Kiev left the city ravaged and nigh razed by the liberating Byzantine armies. A lesson in being beware of one’s allies. The Byzantines carried off the Bulgarian treasury, the royal jewels and regalia, and most of the royal library.</Text>

			<Text>Preslav recovered some of its military importance in the first decades of the “Second Bulgarian Empire,” c. 1185. Indeed, it was – along with the fortress at Tarnovgrad – one of the joint seats of the kingdom under the co-rulers. But the strategic defensive position of Tarnovgrad proved better able to withstand outside threats. The Tartar raids of the 1270s drove off what citizens in Preslav survived; they built a new village of the same name a couple miles away, plundering the once-mighty walls for building materials.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_NAN_MADOL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>Most archaeologists and historians do not believe that the ruins of the abandoned city of Nan Madol, lying adjacent to the eastern shore of the island of Pohnpei in Micronesia, are a remnant of the lost continent of Mu. The city was instead constructed in a lagoon and consisted of about 100 small artificial islets built on stone and coral fill platforms separated by tidal canals. Instead of being left over from the prehistoric sinking of a continent, best guess is that construction of these islets started c. 8th Century AD, and that the construction of the megalithic structures upon these took place in the 12th and 13th centuries. All so the elite castes of the Sandeleur dynasty didn’t have to mix with the commoners.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_NAN_MADOL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The original name for the lagoon-city was Soun Nan-leng (“Reef of Heaven”), and European explorers dubbed it the “Venice of the Pacific.” Most of the named islets were residential, homes for chieftains and priests … although some served special needs: food preparation, coconut oil production on Peinering, canoe construction on Dapahu. The mortuary “neighborhood” includes some 58 islets, covered with graves. Nan Madol was the political, religious and cultural seat of power for the Sandeleur, who had succeeded in uniting the clans (which totaled around 25 thousand people) on Pohnpei and Temwen islands. Shortly thereafter the ruler forced the tribal chieftains to move to the new city where he could keep an eye on them.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_CITYSTATES_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_NAN_MADOL_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3">
			<Text>At its peak, the population of Nan Madol was perhaps about 1000. Since there are no sources of food or fresh water on the islets, everything had to be rowed over from Pohnpei. According to legend, the stones used for all the buildings and tombs were flown to the island by twin sorcerers Olisihpa and Olosohpa, who founded the Sandeleur. Whatever the facts of its creation, by the time the Europeans arrived in the early 1800s, Nan Madol had been abandoned, likely around 1450 when the Sandeleur collapsed.</Text>

			<Text>While the area around Seoul has been settled since the Paleolithic Age, the city wasn’t officially founded until 18 BC when the kingdom of Baekje built its capital Wiryeseong on the site. In time, Baekje developed from a minor state into one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, a group of countries which dominated the peninsula for most of the first millennium AD. Over time, Seoul grew into a formidable city with great political, cultural and commercial significance.</Text>

			<Text>Eventually the Three Kingdoms were consolidated under one rule, and in 1394 AD the capital of this new entity was moved to Seoul. Large walls were built around the city, as much to keep out thieves as well as bears and other large, scary animals … such as those annoying barbarians. Eventually, Seoul opened its gates to the influx of westerners arriving in the Far East during the late 1800s, and the city quickly modernized. In fact, Seoul was the first Asian city to have electricity, running water, and the telephone.</Text>

			<Text>But this isn’t surprising, since Seoul has been the center of technological advances for centuries. The civil minister Choe Yun-ui invented moveable metal type there in 1234 AD to print 50 copies of the Sangjeong yemun … long before Gutenberg stumbled onto the same idea. The Joseon dynasty saw the invention of the water clock, the sight glass, the udometer and lots of other clever gadgets. In 1442, the apex of astronomical advances was reached with the Chiljeongsan, a compilation of computations on the courses of the seven heavenly objects. Then there’s the world’s first ballistic vest invented in the 1860s, a boon to the Korean army.</Text>

Another tale states that the city was founded by the Swede Birger Jarl to protect the fledgling country from invading navies. Regardless of whichever (if either) is correct, the city quickly grew into a center for commerce, mining, and fishing … eventually joining the Hanseatic League.</Text>

The Revolution did not go well, unfortunately, and in 1520 the Danish King Christian II entered the city and incited the Stockholm Bloodbath, a massacre of most of the Swedish opposition forces. Further uprisings across the country in the coming years were more successful and broke up the Kalmar Union (the pleasant name for Danish control of Scandinavia), and Sweden finally gained its independence. The first king of Sweden, Gustav Vasa, was crowned in 1523, and the population of Stockholm began to boom. Within a hundred years, the citizenry increased six-fold.</Text>

But oldest of all is the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, home of the Nobel Prizes, which was founded by famed naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1739. The city has continued to move away from its roots of fishing, mining, and shipping and move towards high-tech research, modern manufacturing, and giving away millions to otherwise obscure scientists.</Text>

			<Text>The most populous city (2.6 million or so in 2011) in Canada, Toronto began as a minor French trading post in 1750 AD after the Iroquois had abandoned the region at the end of the Beaver Wars. But it must not have been a very good location, for the French abandoned it themselves in 1759. The Mississaugas inherited the area by default, but during that American colonial uprising an influx of British Loyalists arrived in the uncivilized frontier north of Lake Ontario. Thus, in 1787 the British negotiated the “Toronto Purchase” with the Mississaugas, securing over a quarter-million acres.</Text>

(Little known fact: the sacking of York was a primary motivation for the burning of Washington by British troops.) After that unpleasantness – and the unsuccessful Upper Canada Rebellion led by Toronto’s William Mackenzie in 1837 – Toronto entered an age of growth, improvement and industrialization. The Grand Trunk and Northern railways joined forces to build Union Station; meanwhile, steamers and schooners on Lake Ontario made Toronto a major gateway to the resources of the interior of the continent.</Text>

For instance, a number of distilleries began operations, making the city the largest producer of alcohol in North America; the Gooderham &amp; Worts distillery became the world’s largest whiskey factory in the world by the mid-1860s. The Great Fire of 1904 destroyed much of the downtown, but the area was rebuilt in a more genteel manner, and much of the industry was relocated to the suburbs. Factories and warehouses clustered around the rail yards and the port. Besides spirits, Toronto now produces automobiles, iron and steel, chemicals, paper, and packaged foods.</Text>

This after the Knights Hospitaller had withstood a siege and invasion of the island by the Ottoman Empire a year earlier.

			<Text>To build and fortify the new city and the island, Valette requested help from the kings and princes of Christendom. And it was forthcoming … obviously their thinking was that it was better for a bunch of militant zealots to face the oncoming Muslims than their own troops and ships. Pope Pius V sent his own military architect to design the fortifications, and Philip II of Spain gave ships and weapons. Others donated large sums of money to sponsor churches and barracks and port facilities.</Text>

			<Text>The town, with its fine harbor and strategic location, was to weather centuries of warfare, even unto the Second World War. The Knights assumed the duties of policing the Mediterranean shipping lanes between Christian Europe and the Levant, fighting the Barbary corsairs and other pirates. They also set about freeing Christian slaves, mostly by raiding Ottoman shipping themselves. But the rise of Genoa, Venice and Pisa, and later the Protestant Reformation, eroded much of Valletta’s financial support.</Text>

			<Text>Lying at the junction of two navigable rivers, the Vilnia and the Neris, some 194 miles from the Baltic, Vilnius was settled as a trading post deep in the woodlands of Lithuania. The town is first mentioned in written records in 1323 AD, when German Jews were invited to relocate to the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Duke Gediminas, who promised religious tolerance and commercial opportunities. Over the following decades under the ambitious duke and his sons, the duchy expanded until it encompassed most of modern Lithuania, Belarus, the Ukraine, Transnistria, and portions of Poland and northern Russia. With the Union of Lublin in 1569, the city became an important mercantile center in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.</Text>

In 1579, King Stefan Báthory founded the institution that would evolve into the 'Vilniaus universitetas,' the oldest university in the Baltic States, which quickly became one of the most important scientific and cultural centers in Europe.

Museums and monuments of all sorts dot the city. The Gediminas Tower, Cathedral Square, and stately Palace of the Grand Dukes, the House of the Signatories and national museums and libraries have managed to survive occupation by many enemies … and since independence in 1990, again form the heart of Lithuania.</Text>

Few records exist referring to Zanzibar until around the death of Muhammed in 632 AD.

The Portuguese pulled out and in 1890 Germany, the only other power with any interest in the region, officially recognized “the British protectorate” over Zanzibar. The protectorate would be unilaterally terminated by the United Kingdom in December 1963, and Zanzibar would join Tanganyika to form Tanzania.</Text>
